Lab | Customer Analysis Round 7

    For this lab, we still keep using the marketing_customer_analysis.csv file that you can find in the files_for_lab folder.

    Remember the previous rounds. Follow the steps as shown in previous lectures and try to improve the accuracy of the model. 
    Include both categorical columns in the exercise. Some approaches you can try in this exercise:

    use the concept of multicollinearity and remove insignificant variables
    use a different method of scaling the numerical variables
    use a different ratio of train test split
    use the transformation on numerical columns which align it more towards a normal distribution
