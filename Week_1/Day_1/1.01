1.01 Intro to Data Analysis
LESSON
Lesson Overview

Data analysis is the art of making business decisions by discovering useful knowledge/information from raw data (aka data-driven decision making). 
It involves various steps but a typical data analysis workflow includes the following steps: Identifying the business problem, collecting relevant data, 
data cleaning/wrangling, processing the data, building models/conducting business intelligence, and reporting/presenting the results. 
In this lesson we will talk about what is data analysis, what do data analysts do, and how is their role different than data engineers and data scientists. 
We will also look at some of the many tools used in the industry to conduct analysis.
