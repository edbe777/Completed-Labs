Lab | Advanced Regular Expressions

    Introductions:

    In the Advanced Regular Expressions lesson, you learned about the various components of regular expressions as well as how to use them both 
    in isolation and together with other components.

    In this lab, you will practice putting together your own regular expressions from scratch. 
    Some of the examples are similar to the ones we went over in the lesson, while others have slight modifications included to test your knowledge 
    and ensure that you grasp the concepts covered.

    Getting Started

    Open the main.ipynb file in the your-code directory. There are a bunch of questions to be solved. 
    If you get stuck in one exercise you can skip to the next one. Read each instruction carefully and provide your answer beneath it.
    
    Submission

    Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
