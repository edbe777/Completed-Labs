Lab | SQL - Lab 3.01

    In this lab, you will be using the [Sakila](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/) database of movie rentals. 
    You have been using this database for a couple labs already, but if you need to get the data again, 
    refer to the official [installation link](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/sakila-installation.html).

    The database is structured as follows:
    ![DB schema](https://education-team-2020.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/data-analytics/database-sakila-schema.png)

<br><br>

    Instructions:

    Activity 1
    1. Drop column `picture` from `staff`.
    2. A new person is hired to help Jon. Her name is TAMMY SANDERS, and she is a customer. Update the database accordingly.
    3. Add rental for movie "Academy Dinosaur" by Charlotte Hunter from Mike Hillyer at Store 1. 
    You can use current date for the `rental_date` column in the `rental` table.
    **Hint**: Check the columns in the table rental and see what information you would need to add there. 
    You can query those pieces of information. For eg., you would notice that you need `customer_id` information as well. 
    To get that you can use the following query:

```sql
select customer_id from sakila.customer
where first_name = 'CHARLOTTE' and last_name = 'HUNTER';
```

    Use similar method to get `inventory_id`, `film_id`, and `staff_id`.


    Activity 2
    1. Use [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/home) or [draw.io](https://draw.io) to propose a new structure for the `Sakila` database.
    2. Define primary keys and foreign keys for the new database.

Lab | SQL Subqueries 3.03

In this lab, you will be using the Sakila database of movie rentals. Create appropriate joins wherever necessary.

    Instructions:

    How many copies of the film Hunchback Impossible exist in the inventory system?
    List all films whose length is longer than the average of all the films.
    Use subqueries to display all actors who appear in the film Alone Trip.
    Sales have been lagging among young families, and you wish to target all family movies for a promotion. Identify all movies categorized as family films.
    Get name and email from customers from Canada using subqueries. Do the same with joins. Note that to create a join, you will have to identify the correct tables with their primary keys and foreign keys, that will help you get the relevant information.
    Which are films starred by the most prolific actor? Most prolific actor is defined as the actor that has acted in the most number of films. First you will have to find the most prolific actor and then use that actor_id to find the different films that he/she starred.
    Films rented by most profitable customer. You can use the customer table and payment table to find the most profitable customer ie the customer that has made the largest sum of payments
    Customers who spent more than the average payments.
