Lab | Random variable distributions

Refer to the files_for_lab/we_fn_use_c_marketing_customer_value_analysis.csv dataset.

    Instructions:

    Get the numerical variables from our dataset.
    Check using a distribution plot if the variables fit the theoretical normal or exponential distribution.
    Check if any of the transformations (log-transform, etc.) we have seen up to this point changes the result.


Lab | Comparing regression models

For this lab, we will be using the same dataset we used in the previous labs.
    
    Instructions:
    
    In this final lab, we will model our data. Import sklearn train_test_split and separate the data.
    Try a simple linear regression with all the data to see whether we are getting good results.
    Great! Now define a function that takes a list of models and train (and tests) them so we can try a lot of them without repeating code.
    Use the function to check LinearRegressor and KNeighborsRegressor.
    You can check also the MLPRegressor for this task!
    Check and discuss the results.
