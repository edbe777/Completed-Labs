Lab | SQL Queries - Lesson 2.5

In this lab, you will be using the [Sakila](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/) database of movie rentals. 
You can follow the steps listed here to get the data locally: [Sakila sample database - installation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/sakila-installation.html).

The database is structured as follows:
![DB schema](https://education-team-2020.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/data-analytics/database-sakila-schema.png)

<br><br>

    Instructions:

    1. Select all the actors with the first name ‘Scarlett’.
    2. How many films (movies) are available for rent and how many films have been rented?
    3. What are the shortest and longest movie duration? Name the values `max_duration` and `min_duration`.
    4. What's the average movie duration expressed in format (hours, minutes)?
    5. How many distinct (different) actors' last names are there?
    6. Since how many days has the company been operating (check DATEDIFF() function)?
    7. Show rental info with additional columns month and weekday. Get 20 results.
    8. Add an additional column day_type with values 'weekend' and 'workday' depending on the rental day of the week.
    9. Get release years.
    10. Get all films with ARMAGEDDON in the title.
    11. Get all films which title ends with APOLLO.
    12. Get 10 the longest films.
    13. How many films include **Behind the Scenes** content?




Lab | SQL Queries - Lesson 2.6

    The database is structured as follows:
![DB schema](https://education-team-2020.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/data-analytics/database-sakila-schema.png)

<br><br>

    Instructions:

    1. In the table actor, which are the actors whose last names are not repeated? 
    For example if you would sort the data in the table actor by last_name, you would see that there is Christian Arkoyd, Kirsten Arkoyd, and Debbie Arkoyd. 
    These three actors have the same last name. So we do not want to include this last name in our output. 
    Last name "Astaire" is present only one time with actor "Angelina Astaire", hence we would want this in our output list. 
    2. Which last names appear more than once? 
    We would use the same logic as in the previous question but this time we want to include the last names of the actors where the last name was present more than once
    3. Using the rental table, find out how many rentals were processed by each employee.
    4. Using the film table, find out how many films were released each year.
    5. Using the film table, find out for each rating how many films were there.
    6. What is the mean length of the film for each rating type. Round off the average lengths to two decimal places 
    7. Which kind of movies (rating) have a mean duration of more than two hours?
    8. Rank films by length (filter out the rows that have nulls or 0s in length column). 
    In your output, only select the columns title, length, and the rank.
