Lab | Random Forests

For this lab, you will be using the CSV files provided in the files_for_lab folder.

Instructions:

    Apply the Random Forests algorithm but this time only by upscaling the data.
    Discuss the output and its impact in the bussiness scenario. 
    Is the cost of a false positive equals to the cost of the false negative? 
    How would you change your algorithm or data in order to maximize the return of the bussiness?
