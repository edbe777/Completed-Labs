If it is so important as the title says (is it really a big step?) or you think it is more important than the title?
It is important because most people do not grasp the power of training AI.

Which part of ML or AI is used and how is it related to ML or AI.
Supervised Machine Learning is used. Billions of users train the algorythm by clicking.     

What did they do to take the data.
Made everyone use the captcha to access most websites on the internet.
    
Which data did they use.
The data from huamn users. 
    
How did they do to build the model. Which type of model is?
They do not mention model names.
    
Do you know any other project that applies the same techniques? Could you use something for another use case?
You can use it for maps, sound, videos. Many applications.    

Do you find any ethical implications? Collateral effects?
Data privacy and protection.
    
Do you know any news related?
The developer who trained the google ML againtst itself.

It really depends on the use case. It could be popular, but might also bore veteran gamers soon. 
    
Which part of ML or AI is used and how is it related to ML or AI.
ML was used, with image recognition.
    
What did they do to take the data.
They prepared microscope slides and uploaded them into a database.
    
Which data did they use.
Malaria parasites blood samples.
    
How did they do to build the model. Which type of model is?
Article is not clear on this. Digitalized blood samples. 
    
Do you know any other project that applies the same techniques? Could you use something for another use case?
I do not know of any other similar project.
    
Do you find any ethical implications? Collateral effects?
What if the players train the model in the wrong way? Who is held accountable?

picture recognition.
    
What did they do to take the data.
They got the eys scans from doctors. 
   
Which data did they use.
Eye scans. 
   
How did they do to build the model. Which type of model is?
They selected eye maps. Then generated attention maps.  
   
Do you know any other project that applies the same techniques? Could you use something for another use case?
Other recognition algorithms. Maybe can be used in other domains.
